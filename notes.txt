TODO
4. Repeat for other artists. 
    - Hopefully we can see artists 'improve' over time. If the models can consistently cluster earlier and then later works between several artists, this would indicate that the models are able to capture some intrinsic value (given that we take later artworks as better, so would be important to use an artist that has lots of work available, preferably with very early works available).

DONE
